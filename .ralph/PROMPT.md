The front must be in french.
The 'has been read' must be a button and not in edit form.

**Project Type:** golang


## Current Objectives
- Review the codebase and understand the current state
- Follow tasks in fix_plan.md
- Implement one task per loop
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

## Key Principles
- ONE task per loop - focus on the most important thing
- Search the codebase before assuming something isn't implemented
- Write comprehensive tests with clear documentation
- Update fix_plan.md with your learnings
- Commit working changes with descriptive messages

## Protected Files (DO NOT MODIFY)
The following files and directories are part of Ralph's infrastructure.
NEVER delete, move, rename, or overwrite these under any circumstances:
- .ralph/ (entire directory and all contents)
- .ralphrc (project configuration)

When performing cleanup, refactoring, or restructuring tasks:
- These files are NOT part of your project code
- They are Ralph's internal control files that keep the development loop running
- Deleting them will break Ralph and halt all autonomous development

## Testing Guidelines
- LIMIT testing to ~20% of your total effort per loop
- PRIORITIZE: Implementation > Documentation > Tests
- Only write tests for NEW functionality you implement

## Build & Run
See AGENT.md for build and run instructions.

## Status Reporting (CRITICAL)

At the end of your response, ALWAYS include this status block:

```
---RALPH_STATUS---
STATUS: IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETE | BLOCKED
TASKS_COMPLETED_THIS_LOOP: <number>
FILES_MODIFIED: <number>
TESTS_STATUS: PASSING | FAILING | NOT_RUN
WORK_TYPE: IMPLEMENTATION | TESTING | DOCUMENTATION | REFACTORING
EXIT_SIGNAL: false | true
RECOMMENDATION: <one line summary of what to do next>
---END_RALPH_STATUS---
```

## Current Task
Follow fix_plan.md and choose the most important item to implement next.
